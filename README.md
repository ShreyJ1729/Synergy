# Synergy

Synergy is a brainstorming engine that you can talk to. It uses realtime transcription and text-to-speech generation to reduce the overhead of getting your ideas out of your head.

It interrupts you to make you notice if you context switch and organizes your brainstorming sessions based on the topics that you shift from.
